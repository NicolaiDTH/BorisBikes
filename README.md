Maker's Academy - Boris Bikes
--
Object Oriented Developing! This week we began learning how instatiated objects interacted with one another. In doing so we started with an exercise MA called 'Boris Bikes' wherein the class was split into groups to present CRC cards and better understand how Ruby could carry out OOD.


Instructions:
--
Choose the boris_bikes directory and run rspec to see the tests.


Lessons Learned:
--
* Object Oriented Developing first steps!
* Value of CRC relationships i.e. Classes Responsibilities and Collaborators.
* Aliases!
* Arrays!
* Understanding 'self'.
* More time spent with instance variables.
* First time with Modules. In this case; 'Bike Container'.
* RSPEC syntax anti-DRY measures implemented.

Problems With The Code:
--
* Some commented-out tests looming in the code.
* Unecessary 'person' class added in.
